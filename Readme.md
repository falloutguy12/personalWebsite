#Personal Web Development Site
Welcome to my personal web development site, where I showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used Figma to whiteboard the original layout and interaction ideas, resulting in a minimalist design that is both visually pleasing and easy to navigate.

One of the key features of this site is the image slider overlay, which showcases my portfolio work and highlights my skills in image manipulation and animation. Additionally, the skills section includes a mouse-over interaction that allows users to see an enlarged version of the icons, showcasing my attention to detail and user experience design.

I am constantly updating and improving my skills, so be sure to check back often to see my latest work. Thank you for visiting!
